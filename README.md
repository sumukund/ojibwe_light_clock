# ojibwe_light_clock
Arduino nano code for a word clock I built. 
Borrowed from https://techniccontroller.com/word-clock-with-arduino-and-neopixel

You can customize this code by changing the language of the clock words and then mapping those to the LEDs that you choose. PLEASE cut your LEDs and solder them flat.
